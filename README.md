# *TeX et al.*

A (mainly paraphrased and extensive but not necessarily comprehensive) guide for and an overview of TeX, LaTeX, and the extended TeX family.

## What is TeX?

**TeX** (derived from the Ancient Greek word τέχνη or technē ("skill", "art", "technique"); pronounced `/tɛx/` or `/tɛk/`) is a typesetting system and computer program, designed and written by [Donald E. Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), that is primarily used for creating beautifully typeset mathematical content and producing high-quality documents. TeX, which is free and open-source, was first released in 1978 and uses the Turing-complete TeX markup language with primitive commands that are processed and compiled using the original TeX engine (compiler). All TeX files have the filename extension `.tex` and outputs a DVI ("DeVice Independent") file with the filename extension `.dvi`.

## What are TeX macros?

A **TeX macro** is command defined using the low-level primitive commands (the "building blocks") of the TeX markup language and/or other macros, and TeX macros are essentially shorthands that can make the source code of TeX documents both easier to read and write. Users can define their own macros which makes TeX a highly customizable typesetting system. TeX macro names are conventionally built from a `\` (backslash) followed by a sequence of letters, which may be upper or lower case but they may also be `<any-single-special-character>`, which allows all sorts of oddities.

## What is LaTeX?

**LaTeX** ([possibly derived from **La**mport + **TeX**](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/64146); pronounced `/ˈlɑːtɛx/` or `/ˈleɪtɛx/`) is a document preparation system, originally written and developed by [Leslie Lamport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) in 1984, which consists of a collection of TeX macros and is a program built on top of TeX to process documents which include complex mathematical expressions and multilingual typesetting. The idea behind LaTeX is to shift the focus from the format to the content of your document ([separation of content and presentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation)). LaTeX is widely used in academia because it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation, and is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. LaTeX is a free and open-source software licensed under [the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX_Project_Public_License).

## What are TeX engines?

A **TeX engine** is the actual program that is used to run TeX to typeset and compile documents. TeX engines are the executable binaries which implement different TeX variants. [There are currently **seven [TeX] engines** (binaries) in common use which can process TeX input, although not all are used to the same extent](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/13601):

1. Knuth's original **`TeX`**, which is the definitive TeX but is rarely used as the standard engine in modern TeX distributions (see [the TeX distribution section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-are-tex-distributions)).
2. **`e-TeX`** (also written as **`ε-tex`**), which adds a number of additional primitives to `TeX` and bidirectional typesetting extension called `TeX--XeT`.
3. **`pdfTeX`**, which implements direct PDF output (but can produce DVI) and adds a number of (mainly) PDF-related primitives.
4. **`XeTeX`**, which does the above and supports UTF-8 encoded Unicode natively, OpenType and TrueType fonts, and access to system fonts.
5. **`LuaTeX`**, which does all the above and provides access to many internals via the embedded Lua programming language.
6. **`pTeX`**, which adds a number of primitives to support vertical typesetting using "traditional" Japanese encodings.
7. **`upTeX`**, which is similar to `pTeX` but allows for Unicode input (with a number of provisos) and also adds some additional primitives.

To clear up a common confusion, LaTeX is ***not*** a TeX engine but a collection of TeX macros, and different versions of LaTeX correspond to different *LaTeX TeX formats*.
 
 ## What are TeX Formats/TeX Macro Packages?
 
A **TeX format** (or **TeX macro package**) is a collection of macros that make the TeX primitives usable for typesetting purposes by humans. TeX formats are the TeX-based languages in which one actually writes documents. Examples of TeX formats:

### Non-LaTeX TeX Formats
  1. **`Plain TeX`**, a set of macros created by Donald Knuth to typeset his books, including the TeXbook.

  2. **`AMS-TeX`**, a now-obsolete TeX format originally written by Michael Spivak for the American Mathematical Society (AMS) during 1983–1985.

  3. **`ConTeXt`** (see [the `ConTeXt` section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-is-context))

### LaTeX TeX Formats

  1. **`LaTeX2.09`**, Leslie Lamport's last version of LaTeX which was last updated in 1992. 

  2. **`LaTeX2e`** (also written as **`LaTeX2ε`**), the most commonly used TeX format and the current version of LaTeX, replacing `LaTeX2.09` in 1994, which is actively being maintained and developed by [The LaTeX Project team](https://www.latex-project.org/about/team).

  3. **`LaTeX3`**, a LaTeX version in development since the early 1990s which was initially planned to replace `LaTeX2e` the same way `LaTeX2e` replaced `LaTeX2.09` but whose features are instead currently being gradually incorporated in newer versions of `LaTeX2e` since 2020.

## What does it mean when someone says they're using `LaTeX` or `pdfLaTeX` or `XeLaTeX` or `LuaLaTeX`?

- **"Using `LaTeX`"** is a phrase often used as a shorthand for contexts where one uses a version of LaTeX (presumably `LaTeX2e`) as the TeX format to write TeX files (with the `.tex` filename extension) whose (PDF or DVI) outputs are compiled using any TeX engine (with the caveat that the original `TeX` engine only supports DVI outputs).

- **"Using `pdfLaTeX`"** is a phrase often used as a shorthand for contexts where one uses a version of LaTeX (presumably `LaTeX2e`) as the TeX format to write TeX files (with the `.tex` filename extension) whose (PDF or DVI) outputs are compiled using `pdfTeX` as the TeX engine.

- **"Using `XeLaTeX`"** is a phrase often used as a shorthand for contexts where one uses a version of LaTeX (presumably `LaTeX2e`) as the TeX format to write TeX files (with the `.tex` filename extension) whose (PDF or DVI) outputs are compiled using `XeTeX` as the TeX engine.

- **"Using `LuaLaTeX`"** is a phrase often used a shorthand for contexts where one uses a version of LaTeX (presumably `LaTeX2e`) as the TeX format to write TeX files (with the `.tex` filename extension) files whose (PDF or DVI) outputs are compiled using `LuaTeX` as the TeX engine.

Also, see [this answer to TeX.SX's "Questions regarding the distinction between XeTeX and XeLaTeX and how they relate to TeX and LaTeX?"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/296623)

## What is ConTeXt?

[**`ConTeXt`**](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/) is a TeX-derived document processor, created by Hans Hagen and Ton Otten around 1991, which intends for users to provide users with typographic control more easily and more directly and this makes `ConTeXt` differ from LaTeX whose original aim is for users to focus more on the content rather than the presentation although the current LaTeX Project has evolved from this vision (see `ltx3info.pdf` linked in the [resources section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#2-the-latex-project)).  `ConTeXt` is a TeX format distinct from other formats because it uses a separate program (`context`) which then runs a TeX engine. This makes it possible to support a wide array of advanced features, such as integrated graphics and XML input, since the control program can determine the flow of processing. For more information, read [Berend de Boer's *LaTeX in proper ConTeXt* (2003)](https://www.berenddeboer.net/tex/LaTeX2ConTeXt.pdf).

## What is LyX?

[**`LyX`**](https://www.lyx.org/) is a LaTeX-derived GUI document processor that encourages an approach to writing based on the structure of documents ([WYSIWYM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM)) and not simply their appearance ([WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)). LyX uses LaTeX as its backend typesetting mechanism but presents the user with the familiar face of a WYSIWYG word processor. For more information, read the [Lyx Wiki](https://wiki.lyx.org/).

## What are LaTeX macro packages?

A **LaTeX macro package** (or simply LaTeX package) is a collection of macros (based on TeX macros defined in a particular LaTeX TeX format, presumably `LaTeX2e`) that are loaded (imported as addons) to add functionality and help users write or improve the typesetting of their LaTeX documents for specific contexts and use-cases. All LaTeX packages have the filename extension `.sty` (as they were referred to as *styles* in LaTeX versions prior to `LaTeX2e`). The standard and proper way to install TeX engines, TeX formats, and LaTeX packages is by installing what's called a *TeX distribution*.

## What are TeX distributions?

A **TeX Distribution** provides a structured collection of TeX-related software, files, and macros, including the previously mentioned *packages* for LaTeX and what are called *modules* for ConTeXt, and uses a package manager to handle package dependencies. Some TeX distributions install everything you'll ever need right away (e.g., **TeX Live**) including fonts and documentations while others allows for more minimal installations which support installing packages on-the-go (e.g., **MikTeX**, see [*Just enough TeX*](https://miktex.org/kb/just-enough-tex)). For ConTeXt specifically, it is recommended to install a ConTeXt distribution from [their official website](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Installation) instead because it is more up-to-date.

There are three mainly used TeX distributions:

### 1. TeX Live (cross-platform)
   - [Installation on Windows](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html)
   - [Installation on Unix/GNU/Linux](https://tug.org/texlive/quickinstall.html)
   - [Installation on macOS](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-unix-download.html)

### 2. MikTeX (available on Windows, macOS, and certain Linux distributions)
   - [Installation](https://miktex.org/download)

### 3. MacTeX (cross-platform redistribution of TeX Live which includes Mac-specific utilities and front-ends)
   - [Installation](https://tug.org/mactex)

After installing a TeX distribution, it is recommended for you to install a *TeX editor* to help you write TeX and LaTeX documents.

## What are TeX editors?

A **TeX editor** is a text editor or IDE that is suitable for writing TeX documents. You can simply write the source code of your TeX documents in something like `notepad` if you so wish of course, but specialized editors simply offer additional features such as syntax highlighting, spell checking, etc. Please do note that an editor alone can not convert a TeX file into a PDF, DVI, or any other output format, but requires programs, mainly a TeX engine, that are included in any TeX distribution.

### Local TeX Editors (Requires installing a TeX distribution)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) + [LaTeX Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install) (free, cross-platform)
  - [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/download.html) + [AucTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex) (free, cross-platform)
  - [Vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php) or [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) + [`latex-suite`/`vim-latex`](https://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/index.php?subject=download&title=Download) (free, cross-platform)
  - [TeXstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/#download) (free, cross-platform)
  - [Texifier (formerly Texpad)](https://texpadapp.com/) (paid with a free trial version, only available on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS with a future release for Windows)

For more local TeX editor recommendations, see [TeX.SX's "LaTeX Editors/IDEs"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/339).

If you're not interested in using LaTeX or if you're simply looking for alternatives, see [the alternatives section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-are-some-alternatives-to-tex-latex-etc).

## How do I install LaTeX on Windows and use Visual Studio Code with the LaTeX Workshop extension as my TeX editor?

See [`LaTeX-VS-Code-Installation-Guide`](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/LaTeX-VS-Code-Installation-Guide).

## What is the structure of a LaTeX document?
A LaTeX document (with the `.tex` filename extension) generally has the following structure (assuming it is the main file, typically named `main.tex`, and not the sub-files).

```
%!TEX program = <pdflatex/xelatex/pdflatex>
% the comment above is a "magic comment"
% for more information about magic comments, read TeX.SX questions tagged with [magic-comment]: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/magic-comment?tab=Votes

\documentclass[<options>]{<document-class>}

% <preamble>
% the preamble is every piece of LaTeX code written after "\documentclass{<document-class>}" and before "\begin{document}"
% the preamble normally contains commands that affect the entire document
% LaTeX packages are loaded with the macro "\usepackage{<package-name>}" and can only be loaded in the preamble

\begin{document}
    % <text>
    % any pair of macros "\begin{<name>}" and "\end{<name>}" is called "LaTeX environment"
    % every text inside a document environment (written after "\begin{document}" and before "\end{document}") will be typeset
\end{document}
```
Note that we can write comments in any (La)TeX document using `%` (a percent sign). For more information, see [the LaTeX/Document Structure article on Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Document_Structure).

## What are LaTeX document classes?

A **LaTeX document class** (or simply "LaTeX class") is a file (with the `.cls` filename extension) containing the general layout of a LaTeX document. As seen from the previous section on the structure of LaTeX documents, document classes are loaded with the `\documentclass{<document-class>}` macro. Examples of LaTeX document classes:

### Standard Document Classes
  1. **`book`** (has `\chapter`, has `\frontmatter`, `\mainmatter`, and `\backmatter`, *doesn't* have the `abstract` environment, starts a new page for `\part`'s heading) 
  2. **`report`** (has `\chapter`, *doesn't* have `\frontmatter`, `\mainmatter`, `\backmatter`, has the `abstract` environment, starts a new page for `\part`'s heading)
  3. **`article`** (*doesn't* have `\chapter`, *doesn't* have `\frontmatter`, `\mainmatter`, `\backmatter`, has the `abstract` environment, *doesn't* start a new page for `\part`'s heading)
  4. **`letter`** (for writing letters)

### `KOMA-Script` Document Classes (see the [`KOMA-Script` section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-is-koma-script))

### AMS Document Classes (see [`amscls-doc`](https://ctan.org/pkg/amscls-doc) for the user documentation)
  1. **`amsbook`** (for books)
  2. **`amsart`** (for writing articles for the AMS)
  3. **`amsproc`** (for proceedings)

### Miscellaneous Document Classes
  1. **`memoir`** (see [the `memoir` section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-is-the-memoir-class))
  2. **`beamer`** (see [the `beamer` section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-is-the-beamer-class))
  3. **`standalone`** (see [the `standalone` section](https://github.com/amanuensisfrances/TeX-et-al#what-is-the-standalone-class-and-package))

For more information, see [TeX.SX's "What are the available 'documentclass' types and their uses?"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/782).

## What is `KOMA-Script`?

[**`KOMA-Script`**](https://ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) ([possibly derived from Ko(hm) + Ma(rkus) + `script`](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/229071)) is a bundle of many versatile LaTeX document classes and packages, originally written and currently developed and maintained by Markus Kohm, released in 1994 as a successor to the [`script`](https://ctan.org/pkg/script) document *style* (a term used before `LaTeX2e` when there was no distinction between classes and packages), written by Frank Neukam. Initially primarily intended to provide good LaTeX classes for German-language authors, `KOMA-Script` currently aims to provide more-flexible alternatives to the standard classes. The capabilities of `KOMA-Script` can surpass those of the standard classes and some of them should be considered extensions to the basic capabilities of the LaTeX kernel. 

### `KOMA-Script` Document Classes

For more information, see [TeX.SX's "Most useful additions in KOMA-Script?"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1351), [TeX.SX's "Why should I \*not\* use the KOMA-Script classes?"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/73141), and [TeX.SX's "Using KOMA-Script packages with other classes"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/165230).

## What is the `memoir` class?

[**`memoir`**](https://ctan.org/pkg/memoir) is a LaTeX document class, originally written by Peter Wilson and currently developed and maintained by Lars Madsen, suitable as an alternative to the standard `book` and `report` classes. The built-in package functions of `memoir` are mainly related to document design and layout; `memoir` does not touch upon areas like those that are covered by the `babel` (for multilingual typesetting) or `hyperref` (for hyperlinks and cross-references) packages or any package related to mathematical typesetting. Compared to `KOMA-Script` classes (e.g., `scrbook` or `scrreprt`) which only incorporate a handful of features but execute them well, `memoir` has many built-in features based on multiple different LaTeX packages, mainly rewritten, but some of the aspects of those features may be implemented better by smaller, individual packages (e.g., `enumitem` for lists).

For more information, see [Peter Wilson's *The memoir class*](https://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-3/wilson/wilson.pdf) and [TeX.SX's "What are the strengths and weaknesses of KOMA-Script and memoir?"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/7742).

## What is the `beamer` class?

[**`beamer`**](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer) is a LaTeX document class used for producing presentations and slides. The class works in both PostScript and direct PDF output modes, using the `pgf` graphics system for visual effects. 

For more information, see [TeX.SX Questions Tagged With `[beamer]`](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/beamer).

## What is the `standalone` class and package?

[**`standalone`**](https://ctan.org/pkg/standalone) is a LaTeX document class and LaTeX package used for producing standalone LaTeX documents which allows users to easily place picture environments or other material in their source files and compile these on their own or as part of a main document.

## What are math modes in LaTeX?

LaTeX provides two writing modes for typesetting mathematics:

### LaTeX Inline Math Mode

**Inline math mode** is used for writing mathematical expressions that are part of a paragraph. The TeX syntax for inline math mode is `$<inline-math-expression>$` while the LaTeX syntax is `\(<inline-math-expression>\)` (or the longer `\begin{math} <inline-math-expression> \end{math}`).

### LaTeX Display Math Mode

**Display math mode** is used for writing mathematical expressions that are not part of a text or paragraph and are typeset on separate lines. The TeX syntax for unnumbered single-equation display math mode is `$$<display-math-expression>$$` while the LaTeX syntax is `\[<display-math-expression>\]` (or the longer `\begin{displaymath} <display-math-expression> \end{displaymath}` or `\begin{equation*} <display-math-expression> \end{equation*}` with the `amsmath` package).

For more information, see [TeX.SX Questions Tagged With `[math-mode]`](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/math-mode).

## How can I type LaTeX macros faster?

I would personally recommend using local TeX editors that support customizable user snippets that may increase your speed in typing LaTeX macros (especially paired with helpful keybindings for code navigation).  I personally use VS Code + LaTeX Workshop (+ [Emacs Friendly Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lfs.vscode-emacs-friendly) for a limited selection of Emacs keybindings) as my local TeX editor and VS Code has customizable user snippets (see [*Snippets in Visual Studio Code*](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets) and [`snippet generator`](https://snippet-generator.app)). For TeX and LaTeX, you can edit the `tex.json` and `latex.json` files respectively to create your own snippets. For example, here is a LaTeX snippet for writing a general LaTeX document structure in VS Code:

```
// in file "C:\Users\<USERPROFILE>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets\latex.json"
{
	// Document Class
	"Document Class": {
		"prefix": "\\cls",
		"body": [
			"%!TEX program = lualatex\n\n% DOCUMENT CLASS\n\\documentclass${1:[${2:<options>}]}{${3:<class>}}${4:\n\n${5:% <preamble>}}\n\n% START OF DOCUMENT\n\\begin{document}\n\t${6:<document>}\n\\end{document}\n% END OF DOCUMENT"
		],
		"description": "\\documentclass[<options>]{<class>} <preamble> \\begin{document} <document> \\end{document}"
	}
}
```

## What is PGF/TikZ?

[**`pgf`**](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) (typeset as **PGF**, stands for Portable Graphics Format) is a lower-level language and LaTeX package for producing vector graphics (e.g., technical illustrations and drawings) from a geometric/algebraic description, with standard features including the drawing of points, lines, arrows, paths, circles, ellipses and polygons. It is platform- and format-independent and works together with the most important TeX backend drivers, including `pdftex` and `dvips` (a DVI to PostScript driver). **`tikz`** (typeset as **Ti*k*Z**, stands for "TikZ ist kein Zeichenprogramm" which is German [recursive acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym) for "Ti*k*Z is not a drawing program") is a user-friendly syntax layer and set of higher-level macros called that use `pgf`, and both are originally written by Till Tantau and currently developed and maintained by [the PGF/Ti*k*Z team](https://mirror.unpad.ac.id/ctan/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf#subsection.1.5).

## How do I load fonts when using LuaLaTeX?
Assuming you've installed a TeX distribution and a TeX editor, I will be giving an example of how to load fonts when using `LuaLaTeX` specifically as that is the TeX format (`LaTeX2e`) and engine (`LuaTeX`) I use the most. First, create a main LaTeX file (e.g., `main.tex`). Second, create a fonts folder (e.g., `Fonts/`) in the same directory as your main file and paste the fonts you want to use in this folder. Let's say you have 16 different font files which consist of 4 different font families with 4 font styles each:

1. `<SerifFont>-Regular<serif-font-extension>`
2. `<SerifFont>-Bold<serif-font-extension>`
3. `<SerifFont>-Italic<serif-font-extension>`
4. `<SerifFont>-BoldItalic<serif-font-extension>`
5. `<SansSerifFont>-Regular<sans-font-extension>`
6. `<SansSerifFont>-Bold<sans-font-extension>`
7. `<SansSerifFont>-Oblique<sans-font-extension>`
8. `<SansSerifFont>-BoldOblique<sans-font-extension>`
9. `<MonospacedFont>-Regular<mono-font-extension>`
10. `<MonospacedFont>-Bold<mono-font-extension>`
11. `<MonospacedFont>-Italic<mono-font-extension>`
12. `<MonospacedFont>-BoldItalic<mono-font-extension>`
13. `<FourthFontFamily>-Regular<fourth-font-extension>`
14. `<FourthFontFamily>-Bold<fourth-font-extension>`
15. `<FourthFontFamily>-Italic<fourth-font-extension>`
16. `<FourthFontFamily>-BoldItalic<fourth-font-extension>`

Next, your main file should look something like the following (there may be other ways but this is how I load my fonts when using `LuaLaTeX`):

```
%!TEX program = lualatex

\documentclass[<options>]{<document-class>}

% \usepackage[<language-option>]{babel} % For multilingual typesetting (optional but recommended)
% \usepackage[babel]{microtype} % For microtypography (optional but recommended)
\usepackage{fontspec} % For loading text fonts
\setmainfont[%
    Scale = <font-scale>, % default value is 1
    Path = <fonts-folder>/,
    Extension = <serif-font-extension>,
    UprightFont = *-Regular,
    BoldFont = *-Bold,
    ItalicFont = *-Italic,
    BoldItalicFont = *-BoldItalic
]{<SerifFont>}
\setsansfont[%
    Scale = <font-scale>, % default value is 1
    Path = <fonts-folder>/,
    Extension = <sans-font-extension>,
    UprightFont = *-Regular,
    BoldFont = *-Bold,
    ItalicFont = *-Oblique,
    BoldItalicFont = *-BoldOblique
]{<SansSerifFont>}
\setmonofont[%
    Scale = <font-scale>, % default value is 1
    Path = <fonts-folder>/,
    Extension = <mono-font-extension>,
    UprightFont = *-Regular,
    BoldFont = *-Bold,
    ItalicFont = *-Italic,
    BoldItalicFont = *-BoldItalic
]{<MonospacedFont>}

\begin{document}
    <text>
\end{document}
```

These are main three font families you will use for your LaTeX document. If you want to occassionally switch to a fourth font family, you can use the `\newfontfamily` macro, instead of `\setmainfont`/`\setsansfont`/`\setmonofont`, and define `\FourthFontFamily` ***in the preamble*** as follows:

```
\newfontfamily{\FourthFontFamily}[%
    Scale = <font-scale>, % default value is 1
    Path = <fonts-folder>/,
    Extension = <fourth-font-extension>,
    UprightFont = *-Regular,
    BoldFont = *-Bold,
    ItalicFont = *-Italic,
    BoldItalicFont = *-BoldItalic
]{<FourthFontFamily>}
```

Now you can switch to the fourth font family by writing `{\FourthFontFamily <text>}`. For more information, read [TeX.SX's "How do I use a particular font for a small section of text in my document?"](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/25249).
